 * @brief The History class stores and restores historical states of ModelInputPictrues in order to provide undo and redo functionality.
 * Therefor the current state of mip is stored by calling ore invoking slot_save(). undo() and redo() then allow to jump back and forth
 * between these historical states. Saving a new state will whipe the "future" states (f.e. states that were discareded by undo()). This
 * ensures a linear history.
